## Recent Updates (2025-06-25)

### Phase 6 Completed:
- Implemented comprehensive game domain models
- Created game repository with PostgreSQL
- Added game handlers for all game actions
- Set up turn-based combat system
- Integrated with user stats tracking

### Phase 7 Completed:
- Designed extensible card effect interface
- Implemented effect registry with factory pattern
- Created 20+ different card effects
- Integrated effect executor with game handler
- Added comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)

## Next Steps

### Phase 8: Enemy AI System
1. Design enemy behavior interface
2. Implement basic enemy patterns (aggressive, defensive, balanced)
3. Create intent calculation system
4. Add enemy-specific abilities
5. Test AI decision making

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Improve error handling in game handlers
- [ ] Add more comprehensive logging
- [ ] Optimize database queries for game state
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for game actions

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Authentication
- POST /api/v1/auth/register
- POST /api/v1/auth/login
- POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
- GET /api/v1/auth/profile
- PUT /api/v1/auth/profile

### Cards
- GET /api/v1/cards
- GET /api/v1/cards/:id
- GET /api/v1/cards/collection
- POST /api/v1/cards/collection

### Decks
- GET /api/v1/decks
- POST /api/v1/decks
- GET /api/v1/decks/:id
- PUT /api/v1/decks/:id
- DELETE /api/v1/decks/:id
- PUT /api/v1/decks/:id/activate

### Games
- POST /api/v1/games/start
- GET /api/v1/games/current
- GET /api/v1/games/:id
- POST /api/v1/games/:id/actions
- POST /api/v1/games/:id/end-turn
- POST /api/v1/games/:id/surrender
- GET /api/v1/games/stats

### WebSocket
- WS /ws

## Database Schema

### Users
- users table with authentication
- user_profiles for game data
- user_cards for collection
- user_stats for statistics

### Cards
- cards master data
- user_cards instances

### Games
- game_sessions
- game_actions
- Complex game state in JSONB

### Decks
- decks with user ownership
- Card list in JSONB

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Card effect system: âœ… All passing
- Effect registry: âœ… Working
- Effect executor: âœ… Integrated

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Full game flow test
- [ ] WebSocket communication test
- [ ] Database transaction tests

## Performance Considerations

1. **Game State Storage**: Using JSONB for flexible schema
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live game updates
3. **Card Effects**: Efficient effect resolution system
4. **Caching**: Redis for session management

## Security Measures

1. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
2. **Input Validation**: All endpoints validated
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries
4. **Rate Limiting**: TODO - implement for game actions

## Deployment Notes

1. Docker containers for all services
2. Environment-based configuration
3. Database migrations automated
4. Swagger documentation included
